# Spec-driven development

This tool aims to show how code coverage and spec coverage are largely
similar. It generates [Codecov]-compatible coverage results by reading
Rust code containing special markers describing what parts of the
specification it covers.

Please consider this very early proof-of-concept quality code and
excuse the many shortcuts taken herein.
