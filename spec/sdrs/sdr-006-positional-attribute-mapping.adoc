== Context

As described in SDR-2, a block can identify positional attributes that should be mapped to named attributes.
These are called [.term]_implicit named attributes_.
They become a named attribute because of their position in the attrlist.
This SDR describes how this mapping is applied, its precedence, and when it occurs relative to block parsing.

== Accepted decision

The specification will state that the mapping of positional attributes to named attributes for a block is applied when the start of a block is positively matched but before parsing that block's content (i.e., nested blocks or inlines).
It will also state that an implicit named attribute can only override an explicit named attribute (i.e., an attribute with an explicit name in the source) if its positional attribute occurs later in document order.

== Decision summary

The AsciiDoc source can contribute attributes to a block using zero or more block attribute lines that precede the block.
For a block macro, the boxed attrlist effectively acts as the last block attribute line.
Those block attribute lines consist of both positional and named attributes.

Block attributes are handled by the grammar in two steps.
First, the attrlist from each of the block attribute lines (including the boxed attrlist of a block macro) are parsed and aggregated.
Second, the aggregated attributes are processed.

A block can specify that one or more positional attributes should be mapped to named attributes.
These positional attributes effectively act as implicit named attributes based on their 1-based position in the attrlist.
For example, the positional attribute mapping for a block image macro is `alt, width, height`.

This mapping is not applied at the time the block attribute line (and its attrlist) is parsed.
Rather, it's applied when the block attributes are processed.
Block attributes are processed when the block is first matched, but before its content is parsed.

This section details how this mechanism works.

=== Parsing / Aggregation

Block attributes are parsed and aggregated from block attribute lines in document order (i.e., top to bottom, left to right).
Both positional and named attributes are extracted from the attrlist of a block attribute line.
The index of a positional attribute is determined by its absolute 1-based position in the attrlist.
These attributes are then added to an aggregate.
This aggregate must be stored and made available to the grammar when it matches the next block.
At this step, the value is typically stored as a deferred function so inline parsing only happens when needed and in the correct order.

If the same positional attribute has already been collected from a previous attrlist, or the same named attribute has already been collected from the same attrlist or a previous attrlist, the old value is replaced (i.e., the attribute is overridden).
Consider the following document:

[,asciidoc]
----
[alt=Alt Text]
[alt=Alt Text Override]
image::target.png[]
----

The `alt` attribute for this block is "`Alt Text Override`".

=== Processing

Once a block is positively matched, but before its content is parsed or otherwise processed, the block attributes are processed.
Processing is the step of preparing the block attributes to influence block parsing and to be assigned to the resulting node.

Processing occurs in two steps: positional attribute mapping and content attribute parsing.
If a block defines a positional attribute to named attribute mapping, that mapping is applied first.
That way, the content attribute parsing operates on the outcome of this mapping.

The positional attribute to named attribute mapping will typically be stored as a constant in the grammar (or read from the extension configuration for custom elements).
This mapping will be passed into the function that processes the block attributes.

When the mapping from positional attribute to named attribute is applied, an implicit named attribute can only override an explicit named attribute if it occurs later in document order.
Assuming positional attributes are always first in the attrlist, this also means the named attribute will win out for that line.
Consider the following document:

[,asciidoc]
----
[alt=Alt Text]
image::target.png[Alt Text Override]
----

Since the first positional attribute is specified after the `alt` named attribute, and a block macro maps the first positional attribute to the `alt` attribute, the positional attribute wins out.
The value of the `alt` attribute is "`Alt Text Override`".

Once the positional attribute mapping has been applied, the parsing of content attributes is performed.
At this stage, all deferred value functions should be resolved.
The processed attributes must be available to the logic in the grammar that parses the block's content (nested blocks or inlines).

== Backwards compatibility

The described behavior is compatible with the behavior of pre-spec AsciiDoc, with one exception.
Previously, an implicit named attribute (i.e., a positional attribute mapped to a named attribute) was allowed to override an explicit named attribute for a block regardless of document order in some cases.
Document order is now enforced.

Since the pre-spec behavior is inconsistent, the specification has established the rule that whether an implicit named attribute can override an explicit named attribute is determined by document order.
The reasoning is that this rule is simple to understand and reasonable to implement.
It's simple to understand because it follows the same rule the explicit positional and named attributes overrides depend on document order.
It's reasonable to implement because the implementation only has to keep track of the attribute keys (1-based position or name) based on last occurrence in the document.
When applying the positional attribute mapping, an implicit named attribute should only override an explicit named attribute if the positional attribute is defined later in key order, and thus document order.
In this case, the value of the positional attribute should replace the value of the explicit named attribute.

== Rejected alternative

The accepted decision states that an implicit named attribute can override an explicit named attribute when defined later in document order.
This decision was made to simplify the syntax rules.
The decision is reasonable since it only has a marginal impact on parsing complexity.

The rejected alternative states that an implicit named attribute cannot override an explicit named attribute, regardless of document order.
Rather, only a named attribute can override a named attribute, which occurs during attrlist parsing.
In other words, the named attribute always has higher precedence.

This alternative is slightly easier to implement since the parser does not have to keep track of the order in which an attribute key (1-based index or name) occurs.
When applying the positional attribute mapping, the parser only has to check whether the name is already set and skip the mapping if it is.
However, the implementation is already expected to maintain the key order to ensure the inline parsing occurs in the correct order.
Therefore, it's reasonable to rely on this key ordering when defining the precedence rules for the positional attribute mapping.
