= Add Link to Image

You can turn an image into a link by using the `link` attribute.

== link attribute

The link attribute on a block or image macro acts as though the image is wrapped in a link macro.
While it's possible to wrap an inline image macro in a link macro, that combination is not well supported and may introduce subtle parsing problems.
Therefore, you should use the `link` attribute on the image macro instead.

The value of the `link` attribute is akin to the target of the link macro.
It can point to any URL or relative path.

For a block image macro, the `link` attribute can be added to the block attribute line above the macro or inside the contents of the macro.

[link=https://example.org]
image::logo.png[Logo]

or

----
image::logo.png[Logo,link=https://example.org]
----

For an inline macro, the `link` attribute must be added inside the contents of the macro.

== Link controls

When using the `link` attribute, you can also use the same controls supported by the link macro to control how the link is constructed.
Those controls are as follows:

* `window` attribute - instructs the browser to open the link in the specified named window
* `nofollow` option - instructs search engines to not follow the link
* `noopener` option - instructs the browser to navigate to the target without granting the new browsing context access to the original document

When the value of `window` attribute is *_blank*, the `noopener` option is automatically enabled.

Here's an example that shows how to use these controls.

----
image::logo.png[Logo,link=https://example.org,window=_blank,opts=nofollow]

Refer to the xref:link-macro-attribute-parsing.adoc#target-a-separate-window[Target a separate window] section in the link macro documentation for more information about how these link controls work.
