// end::b-3p-macro[]

// tag::tick[]
This java code: `System.out.println("No *bold* here");`
will appear in a monospace font but without any other
text formatting.
// end::tick[]

// tag::plus[]
A word or phrase between single pluses, such as +/user/{id}+,
is not substituted.
However, the special characters like +<+ and +>+ are still
escaped in the output.

An attribute reference within a word, such as dev++{conf}++,
is not replaced.

A plus passthrough will escape standalone formatting marks,
like +``+, or formatting marks within a word, like all-natural++*++.
// end::plus[]

// tag::backtick-plus[]
Output literal monospace text, such as `+{backtick}+` or `+http://localhost:8080+`, by enclosing the text in a pair of pluses surrounded by a pair backticks.
// end::backtick-plus[]
