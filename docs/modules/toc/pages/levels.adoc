= Adjust the TOC Depth
:page-aliases: section-depth.adoc

You can adjust the depth of section levels displayed in the table of contents (TOC) using the `toclevels` attribute.

== Set toclevels

The `toclevels` document attribute controls the depth of the TOC.
Accepted values are the integers 0 through 5.
These values represent the section levels.
(A section level is one less than the number of `=` signs the precede the title in the source.)

If the `toclevels` attribute is not specified, it defaults to `2`.
That means the TOC displays level 1 (`==`) and level 2 (`===`) section titles and, in the case of a multipart book, level 0 (`=`) section titles (parts).

Let's use the `toclevels` attribute to increase the depth of the TOC from 2 to 4.

.Define toclevels value
[source#ex-levels]
----
include::example$toc.adoc[tag=header]
:toc: <.>
:toclevels: 4 <.>
include::example$toc.adoc[tag=body]
----
<.> The `toc` attribute must be set in order to use `toclevels`.
<.> `toclevels` is set and assigned the value `4` in the document header.
The TOC will list the titles of any sections up to level 4 (i.e., `====`), when the document is rendered.

The result of <<ex-levels>> is displayed below.

In a multipart book, if you only want to see part titles (as well as any special sections at level 0) in the TOC, set `toclevels` to 0.
If the document does not have parts, and you set `toclevels` to 0, the value is coerced to 1.
