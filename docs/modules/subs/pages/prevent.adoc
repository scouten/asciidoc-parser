= Escape and Prevent Substitutions

The AsciiDoc syntax offers several approaches for preventing substitutions from being applied.

== Escape with backslashes

To prevent a punctuation character from being interpreted as an attribute reference or formatting syntax (e.g., +_+, +^+) in normal content, prepend the character with a backslash (`\`).

.Prevent unintended substitutions with a backslash in normal content
[source#ex-backslash]
----
include::example$subs.adoc[tag=backslash]
----

The backslash can also prevent character replacements, macros, and attribute replacements.
The results of <<ex-backslash>> are below.

====
include::example$subs.adoc[tag=backslash]
====

Notice that the backslash is removed so it doesn't display in your output.

To prevent two adjacent characters (e.g., +__+, pass:[##]), from being interpreted as AsciiDoc syntax you need to precede it with two backslashes (`+\\+`).

.Prevent unintended substitutions with two backslashes in normal content
[source#ex-double-slash]
----
include::example$subs.adoc[tag=double-slash]
----

The results of <<ex-double-slash>> are below.

== Passthroughs

A passthrough is the primary mechanism by which to escape content in AsciiDoc.
They're far more comprehensive and consistent than using a backslash.
As the name implies, a passthrough passes content directly through to the output document without applying any substitutions.

You can control and prevent substitutions in inline text with the xref:pass:pass-macro.adoc[inline passthrough macros] and for entire blocks of content with the xref:pass:pass-block.adoc[block passthrough].

The inline `{plus}` passthrough takes precedence over all other inline formatting.
Therefore, if you need to output a literal plus when it would otherwise match a passthrough, you have two options.

First, you can escape it using the `\{plus}` attribute reference:

[source]
----
`{plus}` and `{plus}`
----

Alternately, you can escape the pair using a backslash.

[source]
----
`\+` and `+`
----

The backslash is only required before the pair, not before each occurance of the plus.
