= Activate Section Title Links

[#link]
== Turn section titles into links

To turn section titles into links, enable the `sectlinks` attribute.
The default Asciidoctor stylesheet displays linked section titles with the same color and styles as unlinked section titles.

[#anchor]
== Add &#167; to section titles

When the `sectanchors` attribute is enabled on a document, an anchor (empty link) is added before the section title.
The default Asciidoctor stylesheet renders the anchor as a section entity (*&#167;*) that floats to the left of the section title.
