= Quotation Marks and Apostrophes

This page describes how to insert curved quotation marks and apostrophes using the AsciiDoc syntax.
It covers the shorthand syntax, the limitations of that syntax, and when it's necessary to input these characters directly.

== Single and double quotation mark syntax

AsciiDoc does not assign special meaning to single or double quotation marks when used as constrained formatting pairs (e.g., around a word or phrase).
In this case, the kbd:['] and kbd:["] characters are taken to be straight quotation marks (also known as dumb, vertical, or typewriter quotation marks).
When an AsciiDoc processor encounters straight quotation marks in this context, it outputs them as entered.

You can instruct the AsciiDoc processor to output curved quotation marks (also known as smart, curly, or typographic quotation marks) by adding a repurposed constrained monospace formatting pair (i.e., a pair of backticks, `{backtick}`) directly inside the pair of quotation marks.
The combination of these two formatting pairs forms a new constrained formatting pair for producing single and double curved quotation marks.

[#ex-curved-quotes]
----
include::example$text.adoc[tag=c-quote-co]

<.> To output double curved quotes, enclose a word or phrase in a pair of double quotes (`{quot}`) and a pair of backticks (`{backtick}`).
<.> To output single curved quotes, enclose a word or phrase in a pair of single quotes (`{apos}`) and a pair of backticks (`{backtick}`).
In this example, the phrase _wormwood and licorice_ should be enclosed in curved single quotes when the document is rendered.

There's no unconstrained equivalent for producing double and single curved quotation marks.
In that case, it's necessary to input the curved quotation marks directly using the characters kbd:[‘], kbd:[’], kbd:[“], and kbd:[”].

When entered using the kbd:['] key, the AsciiDoc processor translates a straight apostrophe directly preceded and followed by a word character, such as in contractions and possessive singular forms, as a curved apostrophe.
This partial support for smart typography without any special syntax is a legacy inherited from AsciiDoc.py.

An apostrophe directly bounded by two word characters is processed during the xref:subs:replacements.adoc[replacements substitution phase], not the inline formatting (quotes) phase.

An apostrophe directly followed by a space or punctuation, such as the possessive plural form, is not curved by default.
To render a curved apostrophe when not bounded by two word characters, mark it as you would the second half of single curved quote (i.e., `pass:[`']`).
This syntax for a curved apostrophe is effectively unconstrained.

You can get the same result by inserting a typographic apostrophe immediately following a constrained formatting pair.
In this case, you're able to leverage the fact that a typographic apostrophe is a punctuation character to avoid the need to resort to unconstrained formatting.
