= Compound Author Names

When a name consists of multiple parts, such as a compound or composite surname, or a double middle name, the processor needs to be explicitly told which words should be assigned to a specific attribute.

== Connecting compound author names

    );

    verifies!(
        r#"
If the parts of an author's name aren't assigned to the correct built-in attributes, they may output the wrong information if they're referenced in the body of the document.
For instance, if the name _Ann Marie Jenson_ was entered on the author line or assigned to the attribute `author`, the processor would assign _Ann_ to `firstname`, _Marie_ to `middlename`, and _Jenson_ to `lastname` based on the location and order of each word.
This assignment would be incorrect because the author's first name is _Ann Marie_.

When part of an author's name consists of more than one word, use an underscore (`+_+`) between the words to connect them.

.Compound name syntax

----
= Document Title
firstname_firstname lastname; firstname middlename_middlename lastname
----

If the more than three space-separated names (or initials) are entered in the implicit author line, the entire line (including the email portion) will be used as the author's full name and first name.
Thus, it's important to use the underscore separator to ensure there are no more than three space-separated names.
