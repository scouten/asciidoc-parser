= Highlight Select Lines

Not to be confused with xref:source-highlighter.adoc[source highlighting], you can highlight (i.e., emphasize) specific lines in a source block in order to call attention to them.

== Usage criteria

Line highlighting can be applied to a source block if certain criteria are met.

[%autowidth]
|===
|`source-highlighter` |Criteria to use the `highlight` attribute on a source block

|`coderay`
a|
* The `linenums` option is enabled on the block.
* The `highlight` attribute is defined on the block.

*Line highlighting will only emphasize the line number itself.*

|`rouge`
a|
* The `highlight` attribute is defined on the block.
* The CSS to support line highlighting is supplied by docinfo.
(Needed even if `rouge-css=style`).

|`pygments`
a|* The `highlight` attribute is defined on the block.

|`highlight.js`
|Not applicable.

*Line highlighting isn't available when using highlight.js.*
|===

== highlight attribute

Line highlighting is activated on a source block if the highlight attribute is defined and at least one of the line numbers falls in this range.

IMPORTANT: Keep in mind that some syntax highlighter libraries require additional options (e.g., CodeRay and Rouge), and some don't support line highlighting at all (e.g., highlight.js).

The `highlight` attribute accepts a comma or semicolon delimited list of line ranges.
The numbers correspond to the line numbers of the source block.
If the `start` attribute is not specified, line numbers of the source block start at 1.

Here are some examples:

* 1
* 2,4,6
* 3..5
* 2,7..9

A line range is represented by two numbers separated by a double period (e.g., `2..5`).
The range is inclusive.

=== CodeRay

.Highlight select lines when source-highlighter=coderay
[source#ex-coderay]
....
= Document Title
:source-highlighter: coderay

[%linenums,ruby,highlight=2..5]
----
ORDERED_LIST_KEYWORDS = {
  'loweralpha' => 'a',
  'lowerroman' => 'i',
  'upperalpha' => 'A',
  'upperroman' => 'I',
}
----
....

When using CodeRay as the source highlighter, the `linenums` option is required to use line highlighting.
That's because line highlighting is only applied to the line number, which is emphasized using bold text.
CodeRay does not shade the line of code itself.

=== Rouge

.Highlight select lines when source-highlighter=rouge
[source#ex-rouge]
....
= Document Title
:source-highlighter: rouge
:docinfo: shared

[,ruby,highlight=2..5]
----
ORDERED_LIST_KEYWORDS = {
  'loweralpha' => 'a',
  'lowerroman' => 'i',
  'upperalpha' => 'A',
  'upperroman' => 'I',
}
----
....

When using Rouge as the source highlighter, you must supply CSS to support line highlighting.
You can do so by storing the required line highlighting CSS in a docinfo file, then including it in the output document by setting the `docinfo` document attribute.

.Docinfo file (docinfo.html) to support line highlighting with Rouge
[,html]
----
<style>
pre.rouge .hll {
  background-color: #ffc;
  display: block;
}
pre.rouge .hll * {
  background-color: initial;
}
</style>
----

Note that this supplemental CSS is needed even when `rouge-css=style`.
The Rouge integration does not embed the CSS for highlighting lines into the style attribute of the tag for each line.
Instead, it sets the `hll` class on the tag (e.g., `<span class="hll">`).

=== Pygments

.Highlight select lines when source-highlighter=pygments
[source#ex-pygments]
....
= Document Title
:source-highlighter: pygments

[,ruby,highlight=2..5]
----
ORDERED_LIST_KEYWORDS = {
  'loweralpha' => 'a',
  'lowerroman' => 'i',
  'upperalpha' => 'A',
  'upperroman' => 'I',
}
----
....
