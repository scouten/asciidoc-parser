= Literal Blocks

Literal blocks display the text you write exactly as you see it in the source.
Literal text is treated as preformatted text.
The text is presented in a fixed-width font and endlines are preserved.
Only xref:subs:special-characters.adoc[special characters] and callouts are replaced when the document is converted.

The literal style can be applied to content using any of the following methods:

* indenting the first line of a paragraph by one or more spaces,
* setting the `literal` style on a block using an attribute list, or
* enclosing the content within a pair of literal block delimiters (`\....` ).

"###
);

#[test]
fn indent_method() {
    verifies!(
        r###"
== Indent method

When a line begins with one or more spaces it is displayed as a literal block.
This method is an easy way to insert simple code snippets.
