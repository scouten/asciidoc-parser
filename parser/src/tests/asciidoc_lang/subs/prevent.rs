To prevent a punctuation character from being interpreted as an attribute reference or formatting syntax (e.g., +_+, +^+) in normal content, prepend the character with a backslash (`\`).

The backslash can also prevent character replacements, macros, and attribute replacements.
The results of <<ex-backslash>> are below.

Notice that the backslash is removed so it doesn't display in your output.

To prevent two adjacent characters (e.g., +__+, pass:[##]), from being interpreted as AsciiDoc syntax you need to precede it with two backslashes (`+\\+`).

== Passthroughs

A passthrough is the primary mechanism by which to escape content in AsciiDoc.
They're far more comprehensive and consistent than using a backslash.
As the name implies, a passthrough passes content directly through to the output document without applying any substitutions.

You can control and prevent substitutions in inline text with the xref:pass:pass-macro.adoc[inline passthrough macros] and for entire blocks of content with the xref:pass:pass-block.adoc[block passthrough].

The inline `{plus}` passthrough takes precedence over all other inline formatting.
Therefore, if you need to output a literal plus when it would otherwise match a passthrough, you have two options.

"#
    );

    #[test]
    fn plus_attribute() {
        verifies!(
            r#"
First, you can escape it using the `\{plus}` attribute reference:

[source]
----
`{plus}` and `{plus}`
----

"#
        );

        let doc = Parser::default().parse("`{plus}` and `{plus}`");

        let block1 = doc.nested_blocks().next().unwrap();

        let Block::Simple(block1) = block1 else {
            panic!("Unexpected block type: {block1:?}");
        };

        assert_eq!(
            block1.content().rendered(),
            "<code>+</code> and <code>+</code>"
        );
    }

    #[test]
    fn backslash() {
        verifies!(
            r#"
Alternately, you can escape the pair using a backslash.

[source]
----
`\+` and `+`
----

The backslash is only required before the pair, not before each occurance of the plus.
"#
        );

        let doc = Parser::default().parse(r#"`\+` and `+`"#);

        let block1 = doc.nested_blocks().next().unwrap();

        let Block::Simple(block1) = block1 else {
            panic!("Unexpected block type: {block1:?}");
        };

        assert_eq!(
            block1.content().rendered(),
            "<code>+</code> and <code>+</code>"
        );
    }
}
