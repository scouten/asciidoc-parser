# AsciiDoc parser for Rust

This is an effort to write a semantic parser for the [AsciiDoc language](https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/) in the [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) language.

As of October 2025 this crate is ready for experimental projects, but still has significant gaps in language coverage that render it not yet suitable for production applications. I don’t list work items that I’ve not yet started; work items that are _partially_ implemented are documented with the [**to do** tag](https://github.com/scouten/asciidoc-parser/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Ato-do) in GitHub. Follow that for the most current status for planned development.

You’re welcome to follow along and contribute with the understanding that I may or may not drive this project a mature (1.0) release.

## Why do this?

Most of all this is a fun project and exercises architectural and project design skills that are different from my [day job](https://opensource.contentauthenticity.org). As part of that work, I write [technical standards for the Creator Assertions Working Group](https://cawg.io/specs/) in Asciidoc and [Antora](https://antora.org).

Once the parser is sufficiently built out, I have a few projects I’d like to build out that depend on it:

* A version of Antora that highlights differences between versions of a spec/document, as in version to version or proposed updates in a pull request.
* A version of Antora or similar that shows what portions of a spec are tested/completed/known good. (See the following section on “spec-driven development.”)
* A version of [Zola](https://getzola.org), the static site generator that I use for most of my web sites, that accepts Asciidoc formatted text as input. (See [Project proposal: Asciidoc support in Zola](https://zola.discourse.group/t/project-proposal-asciidoc-support-in-zola/2867).)

For now I’m still driving the parser to being complete enough for those projects to start.

## Spec-driven coverage

_(aka Why is the code coverage so low?)_

If you know me from other projects, you know that I value high code coverage and that isn’t changed here, despite what the Codecov badge above might say.

With this project, I’m doing an experiment in what I call **“spec-driven development.”** That means not only am I monitoring [coverage of the _code_](https://app.codecov.io/gh/scouten/asciidoc-parser/tree/main/parser%2Fsrc) (which is typically above 99%) but also [coverage of the _spec_](https://app.codecov.io/gh/scouten/asciidoc-parser/tree/main/docs%2Fmodules).

I’m reading page-by-page, line-by-line, and writing tests to verify that the implementation matches the specification(*). This slows progress considerably, but I expect it to result in an implementation that is very solid once complete. I’ve started tracking bugs found via this approach with the tag [#sddbugfind](https://github.com/scouten/asciidoc-parser/pulls?q=is%3Apr+label%3Asddbugfind+is%3Aclosed). There are many already since I started tracking in August 2025.

(*) Yes, I’m aware that the Asciidoc language authors consider this a “language description,” not a specification. Since I’m experimenting with and potentially introducing the term spec-driven development as a broader term, I’m splitting the difference here.

## No planned support for some AsciiDoc features

The following features are supported in the [Ruby implementation of Asciidoctor](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor), on which this project is based, but are not supported – and will likely never be supported – in this crate:

* Parsing UTF-16 content is not supported. (UTF-16 documents must be re-encoded to UTF-8 prior to parsing with this crate.)
* [Document types](https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/document/doctype/) other than `article` are not supported. Specifically, features which are enabled for the `book` doctype are not supported.
* The document attribute [`compat-mode`](https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoctor/latest/migrate/asciidoc-py/#compatibility-mode) is not supported.
* The parser has built-in support for HTML5 rendering similar to what is provided in Asciidoctor. Other back ends could be supported by other crates by implementing the `InlineSubstitutionRenderer` trait. They will not be directly supported in this crate.
* Setting document attributes via the [inline attribute entry syntax](https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/attributes/inline-attribute-entries/) is not supported. (Note that this syntax is discouraged and may eventually be removed from the AsciiDoc language documentation.)
* [Retrieving include file content via URL](https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/directives/include-uri/) is not directly supported. An implementation could implement the [`IncludeFileHandler`](https://docs.rs/asciidoc-parser/latest/asciidoc_parser/parser/trait.IncludeFileHandler.html) trait to provide that behavior.
