# Asciidoc parser for Rust

This is an effort to write a semantic parser for the [Asciidoc language](https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/). 

The project is in its infancy as of December 2023 and in **no way ready to use.**

You're welcome to follow along and contribute with the understanding that I may or may not drive this project a mature (1.0) release.
