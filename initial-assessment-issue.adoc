Subject: Initial assessment

This is a bootstrap issue.
It's purpose is to assess the objective of first release and identify areas of initial focus to get us moving towards that goal.
One we determine an area of focus, it should be spawned as a dedicated issue.
A portion of those issues will be siphoned off into milestone releases, and that scheduling process will continue throughout the 1.0.0 release cycle.
Once the first milestone has been identified, and all substantial topics raised in this issue have either been filed as a dedicated issue or deferred, this issue should be closed.

Since the purpose of the language specification is to comprehend/parse text into a structured document, I think we should start by looking at the document structure at a high level.
Here's an extremely crude sketch to seed the discussion around it.

 Document        ::= (Header?,Preamble?,Section*)
 Header          ::= (Title,(AuthorInfo,RevisionInfo?)?,AttributeEntry*)
 AuthorInfo      ::= (FirstName,(MiddleName?,LastName)?,Autolink?)
 RevisionInfo    ::= (RevisionNumber?,RevisionDate,RevisionRemark?)
 Preamble        ::= (Block*)
 Section         ::= (Title,Block*,Section*)
 Block           ::= (BlockTitle?,BlockAttributeList*,(Paragraph|DelimitedBlock|List|Table|BlockMacro))
 DelimitedBlock  ::= (Admonition|Sidebar|Example|Blockquote|Listing|Literal|Open)
 List            ::= ...

// List            ::= (UnorderedList|OrderedList|DescriptionList|CalloutList)
// UnorderedList   ::= (ListItem)+
// OrderedList     ::= (ListItem)+
// CalloutList     ::= (ListItem)+
// DescriptionList ::= (ListEntry)+
// ListEntry       ::= (ListTerms,ListItem)
// ListTerms       ::= (ListTerm+)
// ListItem        ::= (ItemText,Block*)

For each item in the blueprint, we'll need to look at the terminology, grammar, AST, and DOM.
So we could have up to 4 issues for each element/node in the structure.

We're also looking for topics that we know we'll need to address, either right up front or further down the line leading up to 1.0.0.
Here are a few topics that have come up already for which we know we need issues:

* ADR: What grammar language / framework should we use to describe the AsciiDoc syntax?
* ADR: What format should we use for the ASG?
* ADR: What will be the schema of the ASG?
* ADR: How will we define the DOM in a language-independent way?
* How is the relationship between the preprocessor and parser going to defined? How will we decouple them? (or can we?)
* How are space characters in the source going to be handled? What space characters are permitted?
* What are the rules for nesting blocks?
* Propose the nestable / standard format open block
* ...
